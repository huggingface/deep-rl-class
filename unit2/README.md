# Unit 2: Introduction to Q-Learning

In this Unit, we're going to dive deeper into one of the Reinforcement Learning methods: value-based methods and **study our first RL algorithm: Q-Learning**.

We'll also implement our **first RL agent from scratch**: a Q-Learning agent and will train it in two environments:

- [Frozen-Lake-v1 ⛄ (non-slippery version)](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/): where our agent will need to go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G) by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoiding holes (H).
- [An autonomous taxi 🚕](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/toy_text/taxi/?highlight=taxi) will need to learn to navigate a city to transport its passengers from point A to point B.

You'll then be able to **compare your agent’s results with other classmates thanks to a leaderboard** 🔥.

This Unit is divided into 2 parts:
- [Part 1](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part1)
- [Part 2](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part2)

This course is **self-paced**, you can start whenever you want.

## Required time ⏱️
The required time for this unit is, approximately:
- **2-3 hours** for the theory
- **1 hour** for the hands-on.

## Start this Unit 🚀
Here are the steps for this Unit:

1️⃣ 📝 If it's not already done, sign up to our Discord Server. This is the place where you **can exchange with the community and with us, create study groups to grow each other and more** 

👉🏻 [https://discord.gg/aYka4Yhff9](https://discord.gg/aYka4Yhff9).

Are you new to Discord? Check our **discord 101 to get the best practices** 👉 https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/DISCORD.Md

2️⃣ 👋 **Introduce yourself on Discord in #introduce-yourself Discord channel 🤗 and check on the left the Reinforcement Learning section.**

- In #rl-announcements we give the last information about the course.
- #discussions is a place to exchange.
- #unity-ml-agents is to exchange about everything related to this library.
- #study-groups, to create study groups with your classmates.

3️⃣ 📖 **Read An [Introduction to Q-Learning Part 1](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part1)**.

4️⃣ 📝 Take a piece of paper and **check your knowledge with this series of questions** ❔ 👉 https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit2/quiz1.md

5️⃣ 📖 **Read An [Introduction to Q-Learning Part 2](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part2)**.

6️⃣ 📝 Take a piece of paper and **check your knowledge with this series of questions** ❔ 👉 https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit2/quiz2.md

7️⃣ 👩‍💻 Then dive on the hands-on, where **you’ll implement our first RL agent from scratch**, a Q-Learning agent, and will train it in two environments:
1. Frozen Lake v1 ❄️: where our agent will need to **go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G)** by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoiding holes (H).
2. An autonomous taxi 🚕: where the agent will need **to learn to navigate** a city to **transport its passengers from point A to point B.**

Thanks to a leaderboard, **you'll be able to compare your results with other classmates** and exchange the best practices to improve your agent's scores Who will win the challenge for Unit 2 🏆?

👩‍💻 The hands-on 👉 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit2/unit2.ipynb)

🏆 The leaderboard 👉 https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard

You can work directly **with the colab notebook, which allows you not to have to install everything on your machine (and it’s free)**.

8️⃣ The best way to learn **is to try things on your own**. That’s why we have a challenges section in the colab where we give you some ideas on how you can go further: using another environment, using another model etc.

## How to make the most of this course

To make the most of the course, my advice is to:

- **Participate in Discord** and join a study group.
- **Read multiple times** the theory part and takes some notes
- Don’t just do the colab. When you learn something, try to change the environment, change the parameters and read the libraries' documentation. Have fun 🥳
- Struggling is **a good thing in learning**. It means that you start to build new skills. Deep RL is a complex topic and it takes time to understand. Try different approaches, use our additional readings, and exchange with classmates on discord.
