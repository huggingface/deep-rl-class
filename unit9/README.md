# Unit 9: Decision Transformers and offline Reinforcement Learning 🤖

![cover](assets/img/thumbnail.gif)

In this Unit, you'll learn what is Decision Transformer and Offline Reinforcement Learning. And then, you’ll train your first Offline Decision Transformer model from scratch to make a half-cheetah run. 

This course is **self-paced**, you can start whenever you want.

## Required time ⏱️
The required time for this unit is, approximately:
- **1 hour** for the theory
- **1 hour** for the hands-on.

## Start this Unit 🚀
Here are the steps for this Unit:

1️⃣ 📖 Read [Introducing Decision Transformers on Hugging Face 🤗](https://huggingface.co/blog/decision-transformers)

2️⃣ 👩‍💻 Then dive on the first hands-on.
 👩‍💻 The hands-on 👉 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K3UuajwoPY1MzRKNkONNRS3gS5DxZ-qF?usp=sharing)
 
3️⃣ 📖 Read [Train your first Decision Transformer](https://huggingface.co/blog/train-decision-transformers)

4️⃣ 👩‍💻 Then dive on the hands-on, where **you’ll train your first Offline Decision Transformer model from scratch to make a half-cheetah run**.

## How to make the most of this course

To make the most of the course, my advice is to:

- **Participate in Discord** and join a study group.
- **Read multiple times** the theory part and takes some notes.
- Don’t just do the colab. When you learn something, try to change the environment, change the parameters and read the libraries' documentation. Have fun 🥳.
- Struggling is **a good thing in learning**. It means that you start to build new skills. Deep RL is a complex topic and it takes time to understand. Try different approaches, use our additional readings, and exchange with classmates on discord.
