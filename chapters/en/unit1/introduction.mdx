Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence: **Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Deep RL is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns **how to behave** in an environment **by performing actions** and **seeing the results.**

So in this first chapter, **you'll learn the foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Then, you'll **train your first two Deep Reinforcement Learning agents** using <a href="https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/"> Stable-Baselines3 </a> a Deep Reinforcement Learning library.:

1. A Lunar Lander agent that will learn to **land correctly on the Moon 🌕**
2. A car that needs **to reach the top of the mountain ⛰️ **.

And finally, you'll **upload it to the Hugging Face Hub 🤗, a free, open platform where people can share ML models, datasets, and demos.**

It's essential **to master these elements** before diving into implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. The goal of this chapter is to give you solid foundations.

So let's get started! 🚀
