In this free course, you will:

- 📖 Study Deep Reinforcement Learning in **theory and practice**.
- 🧑‍💻 Learn to **use famous Deep RL libraries** such as Stable Baselines3, RL Baselines3 Zoo, and RLlib.
- 🤖 Train agents in **unique environments** such as SnowballFight, Huggy the Doggo 🐶, and classical ones such as Space Invaders and PyBullet.
- 💾 **Publish your trained agents in one line of code to the Hugging Face Hub**. But also **download powerful agents from the community**.
- 🏆 **Participate in challenges** where you will evaluate your agents against other teams.
- 🖌️🎨 **Learn to share your own environments made with Unity and Godot**.

## FAQ
**Is this class free?**

Yes, totally free 🥳.


**Do I need to have a Hugging Face account to follow the course?**

Yes, to push your trained agents during the hands-on, you need an account (it's free) 🤗.

You can create one here 👉 [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join)


**What’s the format of the class?**

The course consists of **8 Units.** In each of the Units, we'll have:

- **A theory explained part**: an article and a video (based on Deep Reinforcement Learning Course)
- **A hands-on Google Colab** where you'll learn to use famous Deep RL libraries such as Stable Baselines3, RL Baselines3 Zoo, and RLlib to train your agents in unique environments such as SnowballFight, Huggy the Doggo 🐶, and classical ones such as Space Invaders and PyBullet.
- **Some optional challenges**: train an agent in another environment, and try to beat the results.

It's not a live course video, so you can watch and read each unit when you want 🤗
