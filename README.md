# The Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning Class 🤗

In this free course, you will:

- 📖 Study Deep Reinforcement Learning in **theory and practice**.
- 🧑‍💻 Learn to **use famous Deep RL libraries** such as Stable Baselines3, RL Baselines3 Zoo, and RLlib.
- 🤖 Train agents in **unique environments** such as SnowballFight, Huggy the Doggo 🐶, and classical ones such as Space Invaders and PyBullet.
- 💾 **Publish your trained agents in one line of code to the Hugging Face Hub**. But also **download powerful agents from the community**.
- 🏆 **Participate in challenges** where you will evaluate your agents against other teams.
