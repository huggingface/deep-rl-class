# Discord 101 [[discord-101]]

Hey there! My name is Huggy, the dog 🐕, and I'm looking forward to train with you during this RL Course!
Although I don't know much about bringing sticks (yet), I know one or two things about Discord. So I wrote this guide to help you learn about it!

Discord is a free chat platform. If you've used Slack, **it's quite similar**. There is a Hugging Face Community Discord server with 18000 members you can <a href="https://discord.gg/ydHrjt3WP5">join with a single click here</a>. So many humans to play with!

Starting in Discord can be a bit intimidating, so let me take you through it.

When you sign-up to our Discord server, you'll need to specify which topics you're interested in by **clicking #role-assignment at the left**.

In #role-assignment, you can pick different categories. Make sure to **click "Reinforcement Learning"**. You'll then get to **introduce yourself in the `#introduction-yourself` channel**.

## So which channels are interesting to me? [[channels]]

They are in the reinforcement learning lounge. **Don't forget to sign up to these channels** by clicking on 🤖 Reinforcement Learning in `role-assigment`.
- `rl-announcements`: where we give the **lastest information about the course**.
- `rl-discussions`: where you can **exchange about RL and share information**.
- `rl-study-group`: where you can **create and join study groups**.
- `rl-i-made-this`: where you can **share your projects and models**.

The HF Community Server has a thriving community of human beings interested in many areas, so you can also learn from those. There are paper discussions, events, and many other things.

Was this useful? There are a couple of tips I can share with you:

- There are **voice channels** you can use as well, although most people prefer text chat.
- You can **use markdown style** for text chats. So if you're writing code, you can use that style. Sadly this does not work as well for links.
- You can open threads as well! It's a good idea when **it's a long conversation**.

I hope this is useful! And if you have questions, just ask!

See you later!

Huggy 🐶
