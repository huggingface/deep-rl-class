Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence: **Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Deep RL is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns **how to behave** in an environment **by performing actions** and **seeing the results.**

In this first unit, **you'll learn the foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning.**


Then, you'll **train your Deep Reinforcement Learning agent, a lunar lander to land correctly on the Moon** using <a href="https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/"> Stable-Baselines3 </a>, a Deep Reinforcement Learning library.

And finally, you'll **upload this trained agent to the Hugging Face Hub 🤗, a free, open platform where people can share ML models, datasets, and demos.**

It's essential **to master these elements** before diving into implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. The goal of this chapter is to give you solid foundations.


After this unit, in a bonus unit, you'll be **able to train Huggy the Dog 🐶 to fetch the stick and play with him 🤗**.

So let's get started! 🚀
