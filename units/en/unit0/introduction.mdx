Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence: Deep Reinforcement Learning.

This course will **teach you about Deep Reinforcement Learning from beginner to expert**. It’s completely free and open-source!

In this introduction unit you’ll:

- Learn more about the **course content**.
- **Define the path** you’re going to take (either self-audit or certification process)
- Learn more about the **AI vs. AI challenges** you're going to participate to.
- Learn more **about us**.
- **Create your Hugging Face account** (it’s free).
- **Sign-up our Discord server**, the place where you can exchange with your classmates and us (the Hugging Face team).

Let’s get started!

## What to expect? [[expect]]

In this course, you will:

- 📖 Study Deep Reinforcement Learning in **theory and practice.**
- 🧑‍💻 Learn to **use famous Deep RL libraries** such as [Stable Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/), [RL Baselines3 Zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo), [Sample Factory](https://samplefactory.dev/) and [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl).
- 🤖 **Train agents in unique environments** such as [SnowballFight](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ThomasSimonini/SnowballFight), [Huggy the Doggo 🐶](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ThomasSimonini/Huggy), [MineRL (Minecraft ⛏️)](https://minerl.io/), [VizDoom (Doom)](https://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/) and classical ones such as [Space Invaders](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/atari/) and [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/).
- 💾 Share your **trained agents with one line of code to the Hub** and also download powerful agents from the community.
- 🏆 Participate in challenges where you will **evaluate your agents against other teams. You'll also get to play against the agents you'll train.**

And more!

At the end of this course, **you’ll get a solid foundation from the basics to the SOTA (state-of-the-art) methods**.

## What does the course look like? [[course-look-like]]
The course is composed of:

- *A theory part*: where you learn a **concept in theory (article)**.
- *A hands-on*: where you’ll learn **to use famous Deep RL libraries** to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on will be **Google Colab notebooks with companion tutorial videos** if you prefer learning with video format!
- *Challenges*: such AI vs. AI and leaderboard.


## Two paths: choose your own adventure [[two-paths]]

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit0/two-paths.jpg" alt="Two paths" width="100%"/>

You can choose to follow this course either:

- *To get a certificate of completion*: you need to complete 80% of the assignments before the end of March 2023.
- *As a simple audit*: you can participate in all challenges and do assignments if you want, but you have no deadlines.

Whatever path you choose, we advise you **to follow the recommended pace to enjoy the course and challenges with your fellow classmates.**
You don't need to tell us which path you choose. At the end of March, when we verify the assignments **if you get more than 80% of the assignments done, you'll get a certificate.**



## How to get most of the course? [[advice]]

To get most of the course, we have some advice:

1. <a href="https://discord.gg/ydHrjt3WP5">Join or create study groups in Discord </a>: studying in groups is always easier. To do that, you need to join our discord server.
2. **Do the quizzes and assignments**: the best way to learn is to do and test yourself.
3. **Define a schedule to stay in sync**: you can use our recommended pace schedule below or create yours.

## What tools do I need? [[tools]]

You need only 3 things:

- *A computer* with an internet connection.
- *Google Colab (free version)*: most of our hands-on will use Google Colab, the **free version is enough.**
- A *Hugging Face Account*: to push and load models. If you don’t have an account yet you can create one here (it’s free).
