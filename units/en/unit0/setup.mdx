# Setup [[setup]]

After all this information, it's time to get started. We're going to do two things:

1. **Create your Hugging Face account** if it's not already done
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don't be shy 🤗)

### Let's create my Hugging Face account

(If it's not already done) create an account to HF <a href="https://huggingface.co/join">here</a>

### Let's join our Discord server

You can now sign up for our Discord Server. This is the place where you **can exchange with the community and with us, create and join study groups to grow each other and more**

👉🏻 Join our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/ydHrjt3WP5">here.</a>

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in #introduce-yourself and sign-up for reinforcement channels in #role-assignments.

We have multiple RL-related channels:
- `rl-announcements`: where we give the last information about the course.
- `rl-discussions`: where you can exchange about RL and share information.
- `rl-study-group`: where you can create and join study groups.
- `rl-i-made-this`: where you can share your projects and models.

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check the next section.

Congratulations! **You've just finished the on-boarding**. You're now ready to start to learn Deep Reinforcement Learning. Have fun!


### Keep Learning, stay awesome 🤗
