# (Optional) the Policy Gradient Theorem

In this optional section where we're **going to study how we differentiate the objective function that we will use to approximate the policy gradient**.

Let's first recap our different formulas:

1. The Objective function

2. The probability of a trajectory (given that action comes from \\(\pi_\theta\\)):

So we have:

\\(\nabla_\theta J(\theta) =  \nabla_\theta \sum_{\tau}P(\tau;\theta)R(\tau)\\)


We can rewrite the gradient of the sum as the sum of the gradient:

\\(\nabla_\theta J(\theta) =  \sum_{\tau} \nabla_\theta (P(\tau;\theta)R(\tau)) = \sum_{\tau} \nabla_\theta P(\tau;\theta)R(\tau) \\) as \\(R(\tau)\\) is not dependent on \\(\theta\\)

We then multiply every term in the sum by \\(\frac{P(\tau;\theta)}{P(\tau;\theta)}\\)(which is possible since it's = 1):

\\(\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \sum_{\tau} \frac{P(\tau;\theta)}{P(\tau;\theta)}\nabla_\theta P(\tau;\theta)R(\tau) \\)


We can simplify further this since \\( \frac{P(\tau;\theta)}{P(\tau;\theta)}\nabla_\theta P(\tau;\theta) =  P(\tau;\theta)\frac{\nabla_\theta P(\tau;\theta)}{P(\tau;\theta)}  \\). 

Thus we can rewrite the sum as

\\(\sum_{\tau} P(\tau;\theta) \frac{\nabla_\theta P(\tau;\theta)}{P(\tau;\theta)}R(\tau) \\)

We can then use the *derivative log trick* (also called *likelihood ratio trick* or *REINFORCE trick*), a simple rule in calculus that implies that \\( \nabla_x log f(x) = \frac{\nabla_x f(x)}{f(x)} \\)

So given we have \\(\frac{\nabla_\theta P(\tau;\theta)}{P(\tau;\theta)} \\) we transform it as \\(\nabla_\theta log P(\tau|\theta) \\)



So this is our likelihood policy gradient:

\\( \nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \sum_{\tau} P(\tau;\theta)  \nabla_\theta log P(\tau;\theta) R(\tau) \\)





Thanks for this new formula, we can estimate the gradient using trajectory samples (we can approximate the likelihood ratio policy gradient with sample-based estimate if you prefer).

\\(\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m}_{i=1} \nabla_\theta log P(\tau^{(i)};\theta)R(\tau^{(i)})\\) where each \\(\tau^{(i)}\\) is a sampled trajectory.


But we still have some mathematics work to do there: we need to simplify \\(  \nabla_\theta log P(\tau|\theta) \\)

We know that:

\\(\nabla_\theta log P(\tau^{(i)};\theta)= \nabla_\theta log[ \mu(s_0) \prod_{t=0}^{H} P(s_{t+1}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)}, a_{t}^{(i)}) \pi_\theta(a_{t}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)})]\\)

Where \\(\mu(s_0)\\) is the initial state distribution and \\( P(s_{t+1}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)}, a_{t}^{(i)})  \\) is the state transition dynamics of the MDP.

We know that the log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs:

\\(\nabla_\theta log P(\tau^{(i)};\theta)= \nabla_\theta \left[log \mu(s_0) + \sum\limits_{t=0}^{H}log P(s_{t+1}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)} a_{t}^{(i)}) + \sum\limits_{t=0}^{H}log \pi_\theta(a_{t}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)})\right] \\)

We also know that the gradient of the sum is equal to the sum of gradient:

\\( \nabla_\theta log P(\tau^{(i)};\theta)=\nabla_\theta log\mu(s_0) + \nabla_\theta \sum\limits_{t=0}^{H} log P(s_{t+1}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)} a_{t}^{(i)}) + \nabla_\theta \sum\limits_{t=0}^{H} log \pi_\theta(a_{t}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)}) \\)


Since neither initial state distribution or state transition dynamics of the MDP are dependent of \\(\theta\\), the derivate of both terms are 0 
(\\(\nabla_\theta \sum_{t=0}^{H} log P(s_{t+1}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)}  a_{t}^{(i)}) = 0 \\) and \\( \nabla_\theta \mu(s_0) = 0\\)). So we can remove them:

\\(\nabla_\theta log P(\tau^{(i)};\theta) =   \nabla_\theta \sum_{t=0}^{H} log \pi_\theta(a_{t}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)})\\)

We can rewrite the gradient of the sum as the sum of gradients:

\\( \nabla_\theta log P(\tau^{(i)};\theta)=    \sum_{t=0}^{H} \nabla_\theta log \pi_\theta(a_{t}^{(i)}|s_{t}^{(i)}) \\)

So, the final formula for estimating the policy gradient is:

\\( \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) = \hat{g} = \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m}_{i=1} \sum^{H}_{t=0} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a^{(i)}_{t} | s_{t}^{(i)})R(\tau^{(i)}) \\)
