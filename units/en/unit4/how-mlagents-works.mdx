# How do Unity ML-Agents work? [[how-mlagents-works]]

Before training our agent, we need to understand what is ML-Agents and how it works.

## What is Unity ML-Agents? [[what-is-mlagents]]

[Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) is a toolkit for the game engine Unity that **allows us to create environments using Unity or use pre-made environments to train our agents**.

It’s developed by [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/), the developers of Unity, one of the most famous Game Engines used by the creators of Firewatch, Cuphead, and Cities: Skylines.

## The four components [[four-components]]

With Unity ML-Agents, you have four essential components:

- The first is the *Learning Environment*, which contains **the Unity scene (the environment) and the environment elements** (game characters).
- The second is the *Python API* which contains **the low-level Python interface for interacting and manipulating the environment**. It’s the API we use to launch the training.
- Then, we have the *Communicator* that **connects the environment (C#) with the Python API (Python)**.
- Finally, we have the *Python trainers**: the **Reinforcement algorithms made with PyTorch (PPO, SAC…)**.

## Inside the Learning Component [[inside-learning-component]]

Inside the Learning Component, we have **three important elements**:

- The first is the *agent*, the actor of the scene. We’ll **train the agent by optimizing his policy** (which will tell us what action to take in each state). The policy is called *Brain*.
- Finally, there is the *Academy*. This element **orchestrates agents and their decision-making process**. Think of this Academy as a maestro that handles the requests from the python API.

To better understand its role, let’s remember the RL process. This can be modeled as a loop that works like this:

Now, let’s imagine an agent learning to play a platform game. The RL process looks like this:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/RL_process_game.jpg" alt="The RL process" width="100%">

- Our Agent receives **state  \\(S_0\\)** from the **Environment** — we receive the first frame of our game (Environment).
- Based on that **state \\(S_0\\),** the Agent takes **action \\(A_0\\)** — our Agent will move to the right.
- Environment goes to a **new** **state \\(S_1\\)** — new frame.
- The environment gives some **reward \\(R_1\\)** to the Agent — we’re not dead *(Positive Reward +1)*.

This RL loop outputs a sequence of **state, action, reward and next state.** The goal of the agent is to **maximize the expected cumulative reward**.

The Academy will be the one that will **send the order to our Agents and ensure that agents are in sync**:

- Collect Observations
- Select your action using your policy
- Take the Action
- Reset if you reached the max step or if you’re done.

Now that we understand how ML-Agents works, **we’re ready to train our agent** TODO add a phrase about our agent (snowball target)
