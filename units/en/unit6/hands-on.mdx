Now that you've studied the theory behind Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), **you're ready to train your A2C agent** using Stable-Baselines3 in robotic environments. And train three robots:

- A bipedal walker 🚶 to learn to walk.
- A spider 🕷️ to learn to move.
- A robotic arm 🦾 to move objects in the correct position.

We're going to use two Robotics environments:

- [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)
- [panda-gym](https://github.com/qgallouedec/panda-gym)

TODO: ADD IMAGE OF THREE


To validate this hands-on for the certification process, you need to push your three trained model to the Hub and get:

TODO ADD CERTIFICATION ELEMENTS

To find your result, [go to the leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard) and find your model, **the result = mean_reward - std of reward**
