In unit 4, we learned about our first Policy-Based algorithm called **Reinforce**.

In Policy-Based methods, **we aim to optimize the policy directly without using a value function**. More precisely, Reinforce is part of a subclass of *Policy-Based Methods* called *Policy-Gradient methods*. This subclass optimizes the policy directly by **estimating the weights of the optimal policy using Gradient Ascent**.

We saw that Reinforce worked well. However, because we use Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate return (we use an entire episode to calculate the return), **we have significant variance in policy gradient estimation**.

Remember that the policy gradient estimation is **the direction of the steepest increase in return**. In other words, how to update our policy weights so that actions that lead to good returns have a higher probability of being taken. The Monte Carlo variance, which we will further study in this unit, **leads to slower training since we need a lot of samples to mitigate it**.

So today we'll study **Actor-Critic methods**, a hybrid architecture combining value-based and Policy-Based methods that helps to stabilize the training by reducing the variance using:
- *An Actor* that controls **how our agent behaves** (Policy-Based method)
- *A Critic* that measures **how good the taken action is** (Value-Based method)


We'll study one of these hybrid methods, Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), **and train our agent using Stable-Baselines3 in robotic environments**. We'll train:
- A robotic arm 🦾 to move to the correct position.

Sound exciting? Let's get started!
