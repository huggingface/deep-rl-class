# An introduction to Multi-Agents Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

## From single agent to multiple agents

In the first unit, we learned to train agents in a single-agent system. Where our agent was alone in its environment: **it was not cooperating or collaborating with other agents**.

When we do Multi agents reinforcement learning (MARL), we are in a situation where we have multiple agents **that share and interact in a common environment**.

For instance, you can think of a warehouse where **multiple robots need to navigate to load and unload packages**.

Or a road with **several autonomous vehicles**.

In these examples, we have **multiple agents interacting in the environment and with the other agents**. This implies defining a multi-agents system. But first, let's understand the different types of multi-agent environments.

## Different types of multi-agent environments

Given that in a multi-agent system, agents interact with other agents we can have different types of environments:

- *Cooperative environments*: where your agents needs **to maximize the common benefits**.

For instance, in a warehouse, **robots must collaborate to load and unload the packages as efficiently (as fast as possible)**.

- *Competitive/Adversarial environments*: in that case, your agent **want to maximize its benefits by minimizing the opponent ones**.

For example, in a game of tennis, **each agent wants to beat the other agent**.

- *Mixed of both adversarial and cooperative*: like in our SoccerTwos environment, two agents are part of a team (blue or purple): they need to cooperate with each other and beat the opponent team.

So now we can ask how we design these multi-agent systems. Said differently, **how can we train agents in a multi-agents setting** ?
