# Conclusion [[conclusion]]

Congrats on finishing this unit! **That was the biggest one**, and there was a lot of information. And congrats on finishing the tutorial. You’ve just trained your first Deep RL agents and shared them with the community! 🥳

It's **normal if you still feel confused by some of these elements**. This was the same for me and for all people who studied RL.

**Take time to really grasp the material** before continuing. It’s important to master these elements and have a solid foundation before entering the fun part.

Naturally, during the course, we’re going to use and explain these terms again, but it’s better to understand them before diving into the next units.

In the next (bonus) unit, we’re going to reinforce what we just learned by **training Huggy the Dog to fetch a stick**.

You will then be able to play with him 🤗.

Finally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**. If you have some feedback then, please 👉  [fill this form](https://forms.gle/BzKXWzLAGZESGNaE9)

### Keep Learning, stay awesome 🤗
