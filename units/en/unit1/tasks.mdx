# Type of tasks [[tasks]]

A task is an **instance** of a Reinforcement Learning problem. We can have two types of tasks: **episodic** and **continuing**.

## Episodic task [[episodic-task]]

In this case, we have a starting point and an ending point **(a terminal state). This creates an episode**: a list of States, Actions, Rewards, and new States.

For instance, think about Super Mario Bros: an episode begin at the launch of a new Mario Level and ending **when you’re killed or you reached the end of the level.**

## Continuing tasks [[continuing-tasks]]

These are tasks that continue forever (no terminal state). In this case, the agent must **learn how to choose the best actions and simultaneously interact with the environment.**

For instance, an agent that does automated stock trading. For this task, there is no starting point and terminal state. **The agent keeps running until we decide to stop it.**
