# Student Works

Since the launch of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Course, **many students have created amazing projects that you should check out and consider participating in**.

If you've created an interesting project, don't hesitate to [add it to this list by opening a pull request on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class).

The projects are **arranged based on the date of publication in this page**.
