# Introduction [[introduction]]

One of the most critical task in Deep Reinforcement Learning is to **find a good set of training hyperparameters**.

[Optuna](https://optuna.org/) is a library that helps you to automate the search. In this Unit, we'll study a **little bit of the theory behind automatic hyperparameter tuning**. We'll then try to optimize the last unit DQN's parameters manually and then **see how to automate the search using Optuna**.
