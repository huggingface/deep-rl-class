The tutorial environment features a robot that needs to:

- Pull a lever to raise the stairs leading to the second room,
- navigate to the key 🔑 and collect it while avoiding falling down into traps, water, or outside the map,
- navigate back to the treasure chest in the first room, and open it. Victory! 🏆
