# Conclusion

That's all for today. Congrats on finishing this Unit and the tutorial! ⭐️

Now that you've successfully trained your Doom agent, why not try deathmatch? Remember, that's a much more complex level than the one you've just trained, **but it's a nice experiment and I advise you to try it.**

If you do it, don't hesitate to share your model in the `#rl-i-made-this` channel in our [discord server](https://www.hf.co/join/discord).

This concludes the last unit, but we are not finished yet! 🤗 The following **bonus unit includes some of the most interesting, advanced, and cutting edge work in Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

See you next time 🔥

## Keep Learning, Stay awesome 🤗
