In Unit 6, we learned about Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), a hybrid architecture combining value-based and policy-based methods that helps to stabilize the training by reducing the variance with:

- *An Actor* that controls **how our agent behaves** (policy-based method).
- *A Critic* that measures **how good the action taken is** (value-based method).

Today we'll learn about Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an architecture that **improves our agent's training stability by avoiding policy updates that are too large**. To do that, we use a ratio that indicates the difference between our current and old policy and clip this ratio to a specific range \\( [1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon] \\) .

Doing this will ensure **that our policy update will not be too large and that the training is more stable.**

This Unit is in two parts:
- In this first part, you'll learn the theory behind PPO and code your PPO agent from scratch using the [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) implementation. To test its robustness you'll use LunarLander-v2. LunarLander-v2 **is the first environment you used when you started this course**. At that time, you didn't know how PPO worked, and now, **you can code it from scratch and train it. How incredible is that 🤩**.
- In the second part, we'll get deeper into PPO optimization by using [Sample-Factory](https://samplefactory.dev/) and train an agent playing vizdoom (an open source version of Doom).
