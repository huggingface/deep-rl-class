In this second part of Unit 8, we'll get deeper into PPO optimization by using [Sample-Factory](https://samplefactory.dev/), an **asynchronous implementation of the PPO algorithm**, to train our agent to play [vizdoom](https://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/) (an open source version of Doom).

In the notebook, **you'll train your agent to play the Health Gathering level**, where the agent must collect health packs to avoid dying. After that, you can **train your agent to play more complex levels, such as Deathmatch**.
