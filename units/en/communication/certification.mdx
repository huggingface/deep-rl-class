# The certification process


The certification process is **completely free**:

- To get a *certificate of completion*: you need **to pass 80% of the assignments**.
- To get a *certificate of excellence*: you need **to pass 100% of the assignments**.

There's **no deadlines, the course is self-paced**.

When we say pass, **we mean that your model must be pushed to the Hub and get a result equal or above the minimal requirement**.

To check your progression and which unit you passed/not passed: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ThomasSimonini/Check-my-progress-Deep-RL-Course

Now that you're ready for the certification process, you need to:

1. Go here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-RL-Course-Certification/
2. Type your *hugging face username*, your *first name*, *last name*

3. Click on "Generate my certificate".
  - If you passed 80% of the assignments, **congratulations** you've just got the certificate of completion.
  - If you passed 100% of the assignments, **congratulations** you've just got the excellence certificate.
  - If you are below 80%, don't be discouraged! Check which units you need to do again to get your certificate.

4. You can download your certificate in pdf format and png format.
