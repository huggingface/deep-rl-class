# Play with Huggy [[play]]

Now that you've trained Huggy and pushed it to the Hub. **You will be able to play with him ❤️**

For this step it’s simple:

- Open the Huggy game in your browser: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ThomasSimonini/Huggy
- Click on Play with my Huggy model

1. In step 1, choose your model repository which is the model id (in my case ThomasSimonini/ppo-Huggy).

2. In step 2, **choose which model you want to replay**:
  - I have multiple ones, since we saved a model every 500000 timesteps.
  - But if I want the most recent one I choose Huggy.onnx

👉 It's good to **try with different model checkpoints to see the improvement of the agent.**
