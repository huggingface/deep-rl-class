# Unit 7: Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) using Robotics Simulations with PyBullet 🤖

One of the major industries that use Reinforcement Learning is robotics. Unfortunately, **having access to robot equipment is very expensive**. Fortunately, some simulations exist to train Robots:
1. PyBullet
2. MuJoco
3. Unity Simulations

We're going to learn about Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) and how to use PyBullet. And train a spider agent to walk.

🏆 You'll then be able to **compare your agent’s results with other classmates thanks to a leaderboard** 🔥 👉 https://huggingface.co/spaces/chrisjay/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard

Let's get started 🥳

## Required time ⏱️
The required time for this unit is, approximately:
- 1 hour for the theory.
- 1 hour for the hands-on.

## Start this Unit 🚀
Here are the steps for this Unit:

1️⃣ 📖 [Read Advantage Actor Critic Chapter](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-a2c).

2️⃣ 👩‍💻 Then dive on the hands-on where you'll train two robots to walk.

The hands-on 👉 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit7/unit7.ipynb)

Thanks to a leaderboard, you'll be able to compare your results with other classmates and exchange the best practices to improve your agent's scores Who will win the challenge for Unit 7 🏆?

## How to make the most of this course

To make the most of the course, my advice is to:

- **Participate in Discord** and join a study group.
- **Read multiple times** the theory part and takes some notes
- Don’t just do the colab. When you learn something, try to change the environment, change the parameters and read the libraries' documentation. Have fun 🥳
- Struggling is **a good thing in learning**. It means that you start to build new skills. Deep RL is a complex topic and it takes time to understand. Try different approaches, use our additional readings, and exchange with classmates on discord.
